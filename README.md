**Spectrum viewer**

## Description

An early attempt at writing a (1D) spectrum viewer app in Gtk.  Very early, not much is usable yet.

## How to install

Use `make` to compile.  Requires `gcc`.

* Cairo (used for drawing spectra)

## Future plans

* Zooming/panning using the mouse
* Contracting spectra
* Peak labels?
* Peak fitting?
